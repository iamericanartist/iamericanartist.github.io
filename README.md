I decided to use a (heavily modified) theme I found on BootstrapZero.com. I did so knowing that it's a little strange for a developer to use template when they themselves should be able to do this on their own. I FULLY AGREE. I feel comfortable with every technology used in this theme and plan on creating my own site from the ground up when my life settles down a bit after completing my education at Nashville Software School (nashvillesoftwareschool.com), my son settles into his daycare/preschool, AND I AM EMPLOYED!

Thank you for looking at the source code, by the way! I appreciate your time, and would love to talk shop, grab a beverage, or connect in whatever form suits you. I hope to hear from you soon!

Sincerely,

Eric Denton
